# Web application for receiving real time market data and historical price charts for different market assets.

This project was created using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.1.1.

## Starting an app

To start the app in local server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Hosted app

I hosted app on a free Firebase Hosting for a quick view. You can see it on: `https://angular-app-9e168.web.app/`
However, CORS may block API requests, so I reccomend you to use [Allow CORS](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf) browser extention.
