# Real-Time Market Data Web App

This is a web application for receiving real-time market data and historical price charts for different market assets.

This project was created using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) v20.1.1.

## Starting an app

To run the app locally:
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root folder.
2. Run the development server with:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Hosted version

I hosted app on a free Firebase Hosting for a quick view. You can see it on [this link](https://angular-app-9e168.web.app/)

NOTE: However, CORS may block API requests, so I reccomend you to use [Allow CORS](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf) browser extention.
